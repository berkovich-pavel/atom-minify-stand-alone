# atom-minify-stand-alone

Minify css / js files using native json regular expression.

This package is in early development.  
**Do not exclude string literal, which means they may be modified, be aware!**  
However, it works well in most css files and many js files.  
It is recommended to check the validity before formal use.

# Prerequesite
- None
- Anyway, you need an atom.

# Method of use
- `F3` to minify current file.
- `F4` to generate a .min.* file in the same directory with the origin file.

# P.S.
This package works well in my files.  
However, parsing string literal is rather a hard problem for me.  
Leave an issue if you can do this.
