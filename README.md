# atom-minify-stand-alone

Minify css / js files using native json regular expression.  
String literal can be parsed normally now.

This package is in early development.  
Any issue is welcome.

It works well in most css files and most js files.  
However, it is recommended to check the validity before formal use.

# Prerequesite
- None
- Anyway, you need an atom.

# Method of use
- `F3` to minify current file.
  - Only .css file is supported now.
- `F4` to generate a .min.* file in the same directory with the origin file.
  - Overwrite without any confirmation, be aware.

# To-do
- Regular expression support in javascript
- More language support
  - HTML
